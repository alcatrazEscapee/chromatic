### Main Menu

- Render 'X' on completed puzzles

### Game

- Add Filters
    - Graphics for filters in puzzle
- Add tap on pipe input/output to pop up modal tooltips
- When victory happens, raise a modal with 'Victory', 'Next' button, 'Close' button and 'Menu' button
- Add button to return to main menu from main game
- Click and drag on existing pipes to move them, which functions as a replace + drag pipe
    - Click and drag also keeps labels?

### Graphics

- Improve background for tab top/bot buttons in game UI

### Website

- Add some information, lower down on how to play
- Add some images or other information
- Make the background... passable? Somehow
- Add a favicon.ico for alcatrazescapee.com somewhere

### Bugs

- Use `bunny.cursor = 'pointer';` to make all buttons that involve drag actually have cursors
    - Also use this in main menu when swiping?
- Use `pointerupoutside` event to break dragging operations
