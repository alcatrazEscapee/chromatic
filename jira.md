### Main Menu

### Game

- Add tap on pipe input/output to pop up modal tooltips

    - Add an icon on the main menu that indicates you have save data available (in-progress icon)

### Website

### Puzzles

- Puzzle builder tool?
    - Python script to heuristically find valid puzzle solutions?
    - UI that allows placing things in a puzzle? Debug mode only?
