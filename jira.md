### Main Menu

### Game

- Add tap on pipe input/output to pop up modal tooltips
- Click and drag on existing pipes to move them, which functions as a replace + drag pipe
    - Click and drag also keeps labels?
- Store last puzzle ID + the board layout in save data, and restore it if you go back to the same puzzle
    - Add an icon on the main menu that indicates you have save data available (in-progress icon)
- Add a color button that drags null / empty color label

### Graphics

- Make victory modal not look like shit - improve buttons for it?

### Website

- Add some information, lower down on how to play
- Add some images or other information
- Make the background... passable? Somehow
- Add a favicon.ico for alcatrazescapee.com somewhere

### Bugs / Tech Enhancements

- Add a main menu spritesheet for misc. non-background sprites


### Puzzles

- Fix for puzzle 96 (id 95) -> the yellow/blue filters can be bypassed, need to move around some other filters
- Puzzle builder tool?
    - Python script to heuristically find valid puzzle solutions?
    - UI that allows placing things in a puzzle? Debug mode only?
